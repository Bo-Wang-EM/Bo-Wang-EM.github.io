Here is a curated list of useful websites, tools, and books for beginners learning and using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). This list will be updated periodically.

## Operation

*   **[Dr. Nicholas Rudawski's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@NicholasRudawski)**
    <br>An excellent place to study TEM, SEM, and FIB with step-by-step operation tutorials. The channel also features many in-depth talks on electron microscopy theory.

*   **[Ronchigram.com](https://ronchigram.com/)**
    <br>A very useful website to visualize the influence of aberrations, aperture size, and E-beam energy on Ronchigrams and probe shape. Developed by Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer & Will Millsaps at the Hovden Lab.

## Scripting

*   **[Dave Mitchell's DigitalMicrographâ„¢ Scripting Website](http://www.dmscripting.com/)**
    <br>A comprehensive resource for DM scripting. You can find nearly all the functions and scripts you might need when dealing with TEM data in Gatan Microscopy Suite.

Nowadays, it is crucial to master at least one programming language (e.g., Python, MATLAB, C++) to handle the large amounts of data collected from advanced TEM techniques like 4D-STEM and in-situ TEM.

## Essential Books

*   ***Cowley, John Maxwell. Diffraction physics. Elsevier, 1995.***
    <br>Widely considered the "bible" of TEM, a foundational text for understanding the physics of diffraction in materials.

*   ***Kirkland, Earl J. Advanced computing in electron microscopy. Vol. 12. New York: Plenum Press, 1998.***
    <br>Covers the computational aspects of electron microscopy, essential for image simulation and analysis.

*   ***Williams, David B., and C. Barry Carter. Transmission electron microscopy: a textbook for materials science. Springer, 2009.***
    <br>This comprehensive textbook covers everything from basic principles to advanced techniques.
